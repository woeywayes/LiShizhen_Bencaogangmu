# Viewing your Site

Your current visual essay site is based on a single document: README.md. The address for your website is based on the following construction:

> http://visual-essays.app/your-github-username/your-repo-name

Simply, fill in your own github user name and the name you used for your repository. For the next step, we will add some content using Markdown.

**Note:** It is possible to render your site on a custom domain. Contact us for direction here.
