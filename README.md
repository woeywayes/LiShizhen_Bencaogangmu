# Welcome to Juncture

 **Juncture** is a free-to-use, open source framework for converting simple text files into an engaging visual essay. A visual essay is an interactive and responsive web page that augments a text narrative with visual elements to provide depth and context.

With Juncture you can create a single essay or build a full website consisting of multiple visual essays with navigation, site info pages, contact form, logo, and other simple customizations.

More information can be found on the [Juncture web site](https://juncture-digital.org) and in the online [User guide](https://github.com/JSTOR-Labs/juncture/wiki).
