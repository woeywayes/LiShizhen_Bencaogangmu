# Welcome to Juncture

**Juncture** is a framework for converting simple text files into an engaging **visual essay**.  A visual essay is an interactive web page that augments a text narrative with visual elements to provide depth and context.

In addition to converting single text files into visual narratives, Juncture can also be used to create full web sites consisting of multiple visual essays with navigation, site info pages (_About_, _Contact us_, etc), email contact form, logo, and other simple customizations.

## The Juncture framework

Juncture is a set of software components that work with the [Github](https://github.com) site to provide hosting and content management for individual visual essays and full-featured web sites.  Github is a site commonly used for managing content on the web.  Github can be thought of as part CMS (Content Management System) and part web hosting service.  Github can also be used as a simple file hosting service similar to services like Dropbox or Google Drive.  

Github has many advanced features for managing and tracking multiple versions of files and is popular with individuals and teams developing open source software.  While the version management capabilities in Github are very powerful, using Github can seem complicated or intimidating for non-programmers.  Juncture leverages the capabilities provided by Github with an interface that simplifies many common actions.
